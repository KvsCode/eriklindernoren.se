				<h1 id="hello">Hello,</h1>
				<p>	<br>
					My name is Erik Linder-Norén, and I like to build stuff. I'm currently studying towards a Master of Science in Computer Science and I'm really enjoying it this far. <br> I've always loved sketching, tinkering with things and exploring new tools to create with. The joy in building might have originated in my Lego days as a kid, and later evolved to putting computers together in my younger teen years to as of now really enjoying building with ones and zeros.<br><br>
					I love how programming enables people to quickly explore new ideas and I've found that the best, and most fun way for me to learn is to explore the languages and tech in small side projects parallel to my studies and current employment. <br> The results of some of my side projects has spanned from iOS applications to goofy music production software for the OSX platform.<br><br>
					I have since june 2014 been employed by Ericsson as a software developer. I'm currently developing a command-line interface for handling communications with Radio Base Stations using the NETCONF protocol. <br><br>
					I'm a huge fan of all things basketball and watches just about every Boston Celtics game. 
					<br><br> Don't hesitate to say hello!

					<h1>Education</h1>
					<p>
						I'm currently on my second year of studies on a Master of Science degreen in Computer Science at Linköping University, Sweden. <br> The corriculum has introduced programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, C, VHDL and others. <br><br> One thing that I knew I had to do, even before my studies began, was to do at least one year abroad. <br> I was very happy to know that I had been accepted to ETH Zürich in Switzerland. ETH is known as the best university in continental Europe, and one of the best in the world in Computer Science, and it will be a great experience to be a part of the learning culture that they have.

				<h4>Salesman <em>2009</em></h4>
				<p>I was one of the 120 individuals who got employed out of 6000 applicants when Media Markt opened their department store in Valbo.<br> I got a salesman education and got to experience the process of opening a new store. I got the chance to build the custom made computers that were used in the gaming department.</p>

				<h4>Salesman <em>2010</em></h4>
				<p>My employment at Onoff gave me a new perspective on the home electronics business in that they had a clearer focus on sales figures. The sales figures were always available for the salesforce which created a competetive environment which I felt that Media Markt lacked.<br> The store was also much smaller than at Media Markt which gave me a chance to sell from all product categories which was a good learning experience.</p>

				<h4>Software Developer<em> 2014-</em></h4>
				<p>I have been working on developing a command-line interface for Radio Base Station communication using the NETCONF protocol. I was employed as a summer intern in the summer of 2014 and have since then worked on the project in parallel to my studies in Linköping.<br> The application has been developed in Java and it has been nice to build on my skills in that language.</p>

						<em><h2>Geolocation Application</h2>iOS development</em>
						<p>This was a project I did to get more practice with Swift. It started out in me wanting to build a user interface for the Google Maps SDK and then evolved to adding as much location based information from APIs out there as I could find. The application could with the help of APIs from several photo sharing services display the most recently taken photo from the tagged location. The most interesting part in working on this project was using a bunch of APIs together and realizing how much great accessible stuff that is out there.</p>

						<em><h2>Bra Bärs</h2> iOS development</em>
						<p>'Bra Bärs', read in English as "Good beer", was a idea me and my classmates came up with one evening while we were sitting at our favourite pub in Linköping. The idea of the app was to be able to navigate the beers available at the Swedish alcohol monopoly Systembolaget and sort beers by professional and customer reviews, by prices and by the users favourite type of beer. <br>Similar products are available for wines, but as there was nothing like that for beers and the fact that we ourself felt that it was something that we would use made us go ahead and start building. <br> I used the API supplied by Systembolaget to get information about the current supply, and added images from a separate API. There was no way of requesting data from Systembolaget specified by categories at a time, and I thereby decided to build a XML-parser in Java to seperate the data that was relevant to that which was not. </p>

						<em><h2>Sonus</h2> Application development in Java</em>
						<p>This was a project that I did with a classmate in a Java class that we had. The project was not meant to take up as much time that it did in the end, but it was really fun working on. <br> I was after the course ended employed by Ericsson for the summer and ended up building my project there solely in Java and I think that the time that we put into our Java project in the class before helped me out at Ericsson in the beginning. <br><br>Most other project groups ended up doing games as their project but we decided early on that we wanted to build a tool of some sort. We did a little research about fun modules out there for Java and we found JFugue. <br> JFugue makes it easy to compose music just by entering strings of the achords to be played and by what instrument.</p>

						<em><h2>This website</h2>Web development</em>
						<p>I have wanted to get into learning web development for a long time and it was fun to finally find the inspiration. The idea of building sort of like a digital resume came from a friend who talked to me about building one himself and I thought it sounded kind of fun. <br> This site has been built in HTML, CSS and Javascript. During the process of building it I have used tools such as jQuery, Animate.css, Wow.js, Font Awesome and a couple of Google Fonts. Working on this site has been a great learning experience for me and I already look forward to the next web dev project.</p>
